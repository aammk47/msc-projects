Background: This dissertation was written with the aim to investigate the potential ways in
which student feedback could be used to improve higher education. With the
customerization of higher education, students giving feedback to their higher education
institutions is more popular than ever before. Textual feedback has been known to provide
more valuable insights. Therefore, this study applied textual analysis techniques to extract
improvement areas within the MSc Data Science programme.

Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate areas of improvement within the higher
education experience at The University of Sheffieldâ€™s Information School. The main
motivation for this research is to continue the provision of outstanding student experience on
the programme for cohorts to come.

Methods: Due to the nature of data analysed, textual analysis techniques have been
employed. These include the use of sentiment analysis to extract emotions from the
collected comments. This is in addition to using different visualisations (word clouds and bar
charts), and manual analysis.

Results: The analysis was mostly successful. The use of sentiment analysis has highlighted
that all the columns held an overall positive sentiment, despite housing negative comments.
Upon investigation, this was attributed to the use of a professional tone in writing. The
lexicon-based approach has sometimes struggled with interpreting the actual sentiment
carried within comments, resulting in a few outliers.

Conclusion: Out of four research questions, three were answered.
